Python script (tested 2.7.2 /should/ run 2.4-3.x) that compares installed 
version of packages with latest available on FreeBSD.org. If there is a 
newer (different) version available it will output the package info with
current installed version and newer version.

Note: update URL for your architecture / os version / mirror etc.

See ups.txt for example output.
